## 👋 About
I work at the intersection of **health policy**, **statistical/ML methods**, and **AI**.  
Current interests include **agentic RAG** (privacy-preserving, local), **survival analysis** for clinical outcomes, and practical tooling for teaching & research.

- 🔬 *Research themes*: RAG & transformers, survival models (Cox/AFT), health equity analytics  
- 🧑‍🏫 *Teaching*: Python for data science, ML, portfolio theory & risk management  
- 🌐 *Website*: <https://moi175.wixsite.com/analyticsresearch>  
- 🆔 *ORCID*: <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8002-1156>

## 🌟 Featured Projects
- **Agentic RAG for Clinical Decision Support** — local, privacy-first RAG using Ollama; evaluation-ready scaffolding  
- **Hospital Readmission (Survival Analysis)** — Cox/AFT + ML baselines, calibration, and practical validation checks  
- **HCI MCQ Simulator** — generates 50 practice MCQs with answers for fast study loops

> Want to collaborate on **healthcare AI** / **decision support** / **equitable health systems**? I’m open to research partnerships and student projects.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Python**, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Transformers, RAG, Survival Analysis, Pandas, NumPy, VS Code, GitHub CLI (`gh`)

## 📌 How I work
- Reproducible notebooks & clear READMEs  
- Preference for local privacy-preserving setups (air-gapped when needed)  
- “Small wins first” → baseline, then iterate with measurable improvements
