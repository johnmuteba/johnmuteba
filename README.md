## 👋 About
I work at the intersection of  **financial economics**, **health informatics**, **statistical/ML methods**, and **AI**.  
Current interests include **agentic RAG** (privacy-preserving, local), **survival analysis** for clinical outcomes, and practical tooling for teaching & research.

- 🔬 *Research themes*: AI applications in financial economics, RAG & transformers, survival models (Cox/AFT), health informatics -decision support systems  
- 🧑‍🏫 *Teaching*: Python for data science, ML, portfolio theory & risk management  
- 🌐 *Website*: <https://moi175.wixsite.com/analyticsresearch>  
- 🆔 *ORCID*: <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8002-1156>

## 🌟 Featured Projects
- **EquiMed-DSS** — a novel tri-corpus framework for  evaluation of decision support systems in healthcare using novel metrics and advanced statistical analyses (hierarchical, mediation, and network analyses) 
- **Optimal Hospital Ressources Allocation** — the first integrated, two-stage stochastic programming framework that jointly optimizes hospital beds, nursing, and physician staffing.  
- **Stochastic Prediction of Patient State Path** — developing a Theory of Clinical State Trajectories to model patient health dynamics from clinical notes as a text-inferred stochastic jump-diffusion process.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Python**, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Transformers, RAG, Survival Analysis, Pandas, NumPy, VS Code, GitHub CLI (`gh`)

## 📌 How I work
- Reproducible notebooks & clear READMEs  
- Preference for local privacy-preserving setups (air-gapped when needed)  
- “Small wins first” → baseline, then iterate with measurable improvements
